# Lecture 2:

We can distinguish different categories of knowledge to collect. There are 3 main categories of **knowledge**:

1. **Descriptive**, like *observation*
2. **Prescriptive**, like *specification*
3. **Predictive**

This categorization is only to make easier to memorize different kind of knowledge.

## But **what is knowledge?**

<img src="C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304091030991.png" alt="image-20240304091030991" style="zoom:80%;" />

So as it is written over here, *knowledge* is an organisation of infos, linked to a specific context, that take place over the data (the foundation) and the information.

To get *knowledge* we need analytics and tool to explore datas and infos.

**Wisdom** is the use of *knowledge*, sometimes is decision making (in front of uncertain) and so on.

## Knowledge acquisition:

The main goal of data analytics, or just a part of it. The **data** must be prepared to become infos, **infos** must be integrated, aggregated and filtered, while **knowledge** is the final stage of *descriptive data analytics*. In the end the **wisdom** is for *predictive analytics*.

> We are gonna focus on Knowledge Improvement in organisations using Information System.
>
> For our project we have to start by focussing on this. We have to follow these step in order to make it good. (See slides one at Knowledge section). It is secondary to retrieve the conclusion in the project, the main focus remain the metodology followed, how it was followed and how we arrived on conclusion. Show the path from *data* to *understanding*.

### For the case of study:

![image-20240304095437069](C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304095437069.png)

The main goal was **reduce the cost of call-centre**, the sub-goals or in any way strictly related to this goal (wanted or unwanted) was to satisfy the customers more, by reducing the needs of interaction this sub goal was satisfied.

## Slides2:

An Informations System needs technical specification, that are **essential to document the development life cycle**. That allows us to identify, describe, prescribed and verify what we want to implement and the provide input to predictive models to shape the observed trends.

Among the specs we have:

- **Goals**
- **Business Rules**
- **Business Process Models**
- **Data Flow Models**
- **Others...** like reports, surveys, logs, directives, ontologies, regulation, requirements and so on

But **to be effective the must be compared to observations** in order to verify our achiviements and acquire new knowledge.

### Goals:

Capturing goals permits us to focus on *relevant activities* while understanding the interconnections, exploring alternatives and accessing the perfomance. Many metodology provide **little explicit support** for eliciting and representing goals.

#### KPI: [so important]

<img src="C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304101334413.png" alt="image-20240304101334413" style="zoom: 67%;" />

An important indicator of goals that **measure one or more measurable dimensions**.

There are multiple dimensions so we need a *function aggregating them* to generate a sngle value of the indicator. Something like $\%overdue\_cases \space := \frac{\space overdue\_cases}{total\_cases} * 100$.

The values that the indicator get are often referred as levels. May be connected to an objective stating the level to be achieved.

> There are three main steps to get a KPI, but **there is no need to invent it**, we already have KPIs for different sectors. We have to follow standards because of the needs of comparison with other companies!!

We have **balanced scorecard** as a popular methodology to identify the organisational goals, define the KPI and monitor them!

### E3Value: [important as fuck in the project i guess]

Un tool che utilizzeremo per modellare valori, il quale ha molte componenti che si interconnettono per indicare processi di business e i valori che essi generano e non solo. Generalmente avremo:

- Actor
- Value Object
- Value Interface
- Value O ering
- Value Transfer
- Market Segment
- Value Activity
- Composed actor

A **value model** is usefull for **compare multiple versions** of a model, like the **AS-IS** version and the **TO-BE** model!

#### Business Rules: [so important]

They constraint the operations that apply to an organisation. They were designed to help an organisation in achiving goals and to provide efficienty, conssitency and predictability.

The Business Rules Group BRs can:

- **Define a vocabulary** (terms adopted in the organisation)
- **Describe facts** (that may be observed in the organisation)
- **Constraint the behaviour** of the organisation
- **Explain how knowledge can be derived/transormed**

BRs can be documented as Natural Languages, Controleld Languages or structures in a Graphical Model

A semiformal language is preferred in this context, something like **Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules**, an OMG standards for specifing business rules. A subset of standard English with restricted syntax and semantics.

#### OMG Standards:

- **Terms**, like *branch, agency, Italy*
- **Verbs**, like branch *has* car storage capacity or date/time1 *is after* date/time2
- **Individuals**, like *the* rental car or *the* driver, date/time*1*
- **Definitions**, like the rental car has the set of style and feature properties of the car model or agency is a branch that is not located at a EU-Rennt-owned site and i operated by some agent

Business Rules may be **alethic** or **deontic**:

- **Alethic** indicates *how the world is*. If violated it indicates a dysfunction or impairment in the operation of the organisation. [Come Ã©]
- **Deontic** indicates *how the world ought to be*. If violated it indicates a missed goal or an unachieved performance. [Come dovrebbe essere]

A subset of the langue can be mapped on *First Order Logic* or to other formal languages in the family of *Temporal Logic* and *Modal Logic*.

### Business process Model: [the most important one in our examples]

<img src="C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304110739698.png" alt="image-20240304110739698" style="zoom:67%;" />

Composed by Actors, Objects, Relationship and more. It serves us to describe a business process visually and produce specifing outcomes!

<img src="C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304110932044.png" alt="image-20240304110932044" style="zoom:67%;" />

We can have this types of graph, that moves in times involving various actor (lanes) and actions. It also describe **decision points** as control flow, where we need to take a decision answering a question (usually bynary questions).

#### BPMN:

![image-20240304111134387](C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304111134387.png)

OMG developed a standard Business Process Modeling Notation, called BPMN. We have events (point of start/end, mid points), activity that has to be done, gateway that responds to a specific constraint and connections that indicates the flow or the association needed.

![image-20240304111633263](C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304111633263.png)

The annotation are important to describe constraint and specific context, to acknowledge the watcher of some special cases.

##### Example one, no swimming lanes:

![image-20240304111758756](C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304111758756.png)

##### More complicated example:

![image-20240304112054069](C:\Users\pietro\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240304112054069.png)

Describe steps and merge them into one things using swimming lanes concept.

### Data flows:

Focussed on what should happens in the software that we are gonna use. Are the **interstection between Process Management and Infrastructures Models**.

So it evolves BPM into an utilizable flow diagram to be used in our software workflow! We have a lot of notations and we are free to use them.

The most important concept of data flows is **they can be organised at different levels of detail!** From Context Diagram to Level 2 Diagram! Let's explore this:

- **Context Diagram**
  - shows the context into which the business process fits. Show the *overall business process as one process*
- **Level 0 Diagram**
  - Starts to dive in
- **Level 1...**

The aspects to consider at this desing level are thos that *impact the data processing tasks* like **stream vs batch processing** or **consistency vs avaibility** or **ETL vs ELT** and so on...

Like Consistency cannot be good when we operate in web app, that can be a drawback, like in social network. Is not critical that my like the person see it, it is better the avaibility of that post...
