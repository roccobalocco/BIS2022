# Process Mining:

> **Event Log:**
>
> A collection of events recorder by an Information System

> **Case:**
>
> A collection of events relatedto the same process execution

> **Variant:**
>
> A collection of cases following the same trace

> **Process Model:**
>
> A collection of logical specifications that prescribe the sequence, the synchronization, the pre and post conditions of activities, steps or procedures to be implemented to reach a goal.

A little view on process mining is following:

## Use cases of Process Mining:

| Process Optimization                 | PM can be used for faster and more accurate analysis of processes. The event logs can infer performance metrics and can identify bottlenecks-costly steps |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Process Discovery for automation** |                                                              |
| **Conformance** **validation**       |                                                              |
| **Process simulation**               |                                                              |

# Variant Analysis:

> **The first part of our project** :warning:

In general mean values are not reliable, but when you have splitted distribution means values are worst:

So we have to use another kind of stuff or we have to clean up our datas, before doing that!

In **event logs** we have multiple variants, so the process **variant analysis** comes to help. It is a *family of techinques to analyze event logs produced during the execution of a process, in order to explain the differences between the executed cases*.

Understanding differences between process variants helps to make informed decisions as to how to standardize or improve business process.

> A **variant** is a collection of cases following the same trace, the same sequence of activities.
>
> Bu this notion can **be relaxed** considering collections of cases following a same set of constraints:
>
> - Having the same start and end
> - Including one specific activity
> - Having cycle time higher than 3 hours
> - Started by resource of type consultatnt
>
> We can speak about **variant analysis**, in an extensive sense, for any analysis on any segment of the Event Log.

In A we have the cases that we have to improve to make a giant impact in the business process.

In B the impact will be good, but the benefit will be less.

In C you do not have to do nothing.

The aim is to **reduce the variability** to 2 process! So for the C category we have to make her disappear!
